This repository contains the results of the paper [Word Embeddings Quantify 100 Years of Gender and Ethnic
Stereotypes](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1720347115) reproduced using STILE. 


The PDF contains the screenshots of biases identified from Google News Embedding using STILE. The screenshots show that similar biases were also identified by the Relative Norm Difference bias metric[1] from Google News Embedding.
